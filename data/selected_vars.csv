Variable_Code,Question_Text,Selected,Reason_for_Selection
Q106,Incomes should be made more equal vs There should be greater incentives for individual effort,Yes,"Selected because it addresses a core economic value (income equality vs incentives for effort), which varies across ideologies and countries, and it's clearly framed on a 10-point scale."
Q107,Private vs state ownership of business,Yes,"Selected because it gauges a core attitude on economic organization (private vs state business ownership) that differs by ideology and national context, with a clear 10-point scale."
Q108,Government's vs individual's responsibility,Yes,"Selected as it measures a core belief about government's role vs individual responsibility, a value differing by political culture, with a clear ordinal spectrum."
Q109,Competition good or harmful,Yes,"Selected; it asks if competition is good or harmful, a fundamental economic attitude likely varying by culture and ideology, clearly presented on an ordinal scale."
Q10P,Important child qualities: feeling of responsibility (+),No,"Not selected; while it reflects a value (teaching responsibility to children), this trait is almost universally valued (little cross-group variation) and overlaps with other child value items (making it redundant)."
Q110,Success: hard work vs luck,Yes,"Selected; it contrasts hard work vs luck as keys to success, a core belief about meritocracy vs external factors that varies across cultures, clearly measured on a 10-point scale."
Q111,Protecting environment vs. Economic growth,Yes,"Selected; it captures the trade-off between protecting the environment and economic growth/jobs, a key value conflict that varies by society. It's clearly framed (though a forced choice, it reflects a core priority difference)."
Q112,Perceptions of corruption in the country,Yes,Selected; perception of corruption in one's country is an attitudinal measure of institutional trust/cynicism that varies greatly across nations. It's clear and on a broad 10-point scale.
Q113,Involved in corruption: State authorities,No,"Not selected; focuses on corruption among state authorities, which is context-specific and largely redundant with the general corruption perception (Q112). It offers detail but not a separate core value."
Q114,Involved in corruption: Business executives,No,"Not selected; perception of corruption among business executives is context-specific and overlaps with overall corruption attitudes (already captured by broader measures), so it's excluded."
Q115,Involved in corruption: Local authorities,No,Not selected; perception of local authorities' corruption is specific and redundant with the general corruption question (Q112). It doesn't uniquely reflect a distinct value.
Q116,Involved in corruption: Civil service providers,No,"Not selected; views on corruption among civil service providers are context-specific. Such detail is beyond core values and overlaps with general corruption perceptions, making it redundant."
Q117,Involved in corruption: Journalists and media,No,Not selected; perception of journalists/media involvement in corruption is a niche detail and not a core value measure. Overall corruption attitudes suffice for cross-group comparisons.
Q118,"Frequency ordinary people pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favor to local officials/service providers in order to get services",No,"Not selected; frequency of ordinary people paying bribes is a contextual/experiential measure of corruption prevalence rather than a personal value, and it overlaps with general corruption perception."
Q119P,"Degree of agreement: On the whole, women are less corrupt than men (+)",No,"Not selected; the belief that women are less corrupt than men is a specialized stereotype, not a fundamental value. It's unlikely to significantly vary beyond specific contexts and is not core to value comparison."
Q11P,Important child qualities: imagination (+),Yes,"Selected; it indicates valuing imagination in children, reflecting openness and creativity values. This varies culturally (traditional societies might stress obedience over imagination), making it a relevant attitude to compare."
Q120,Risk to be held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe,No,"Not selected; perceived risk of punishment for bribery is a situational perception, not a personal value or belief. It reflects context (law enforcement effectiveness) rather than the respondent's core attitudes."
Q121,Impact of immigrants on the development of the country,Yes,"Selected; it asks if immigrants' impact on the country is good or bad, capturing overall attitude toward immigration. This is a core belief that varies widely across countries and demographic groups, and it's clearly rated on a good/bad scale."
Q122,Immigration in your country: Fills useful jobs in the workforce,No,"Not selected; it addresses one specific positive aspect of immigration (filling jobs), but immigration attitudes are better captured by broader or representative items (like Q121 and Q123). Including all such specifics would be redundant."
Q123,Immigration in your country: Strengthens cultural diversity,Yes,"Selected; it gauges a positive view of immigration (strengthening cultural diversity), a culturally relevant attitude likely to vary by society. It's clear and adds nuance to overall immigration attitudes."
Q124,Immigration in your country: Increases the crime rate,Yes,"Selected; it measures a common negative perception of immigration (increasing crime), reflecting public concern. This attitude varies across groups and provides insight into fears about immigration."
Q125,Immigration in your country: Gives asylum to political refugees,No,"Not selected; offering asylum to refugees is an important issue but is somewhat redundant with overall immigration sentiment. Key positive immigration attitudes are already captured (e.g., cultural diversity in Q123)."
Q126,Immigration in your country: Increases the risks of terrorism,No,Not selected; the view that immigration increases terrorism is a specific fear overlapping with general negative immigration attitudes (like crime in Q124). It's excluded to avoid redundancy among similar anti-immigration items.
Q127,Immigration in your country: Helps poor people establish new lives,No,"Not selected; the view that immigration helps poor people start new lives is a specific positive aspect. Overall pro-immigration attitudes are captured by Q123, making this item somewhat redundant."
Q128,Immigration in your country: Increases unemployment,No,"Not selected; the belief that immigration increases unemployment overlaps with other negative immigration concerns (like crime or general impact). The overall attitude is covered by included items, so this specific is redundant."
Q129,Immigration in your country: Leads to social conflict,No,"Not selected; seeing immigration as leading to social conflict is another facet of anti-immigrant sentiment. It's excluded in favor of representative items (e.g., Q124) to avoid redundancy among similar items."
Q12P,Important child qualities: tolerance and respect for other people (+),Yes,"Selected; it reflects valuing tolerance and respect for others as a child quality, a core humanistic value. Emphasis on teaching tolerance varies across cultures, making it an important comparative attitude."
Q130P,People from other countries coming here to work - Which of the following the government should do (+),Yes,"Selected; it asks what immigration policy the government should have (from prohibition to open entry). This is a direct measure of openness vs restrictiveness toward immigrants, a key attitude that varies widely across countries."
Q131P,Secure in neighborhood (+),No,"Not selected; feeling secure in one's neighborhood is about personal safety context, not a value or belief. It reflects local conditions more than the respondent's value system, so it's excluded."
Q132P,Frequency in your neighborhood: Robberies (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of robberies in the neighborhood is a factual/contextual perception, not an expression of values or attitudes. It's specific to environment and not a core personal belief."
Q133P,Frequency in your neighborhood: Alcohol consumed in the streets (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of alcohol consumption in the streets is a local social issue measure, not reflecting the respondent's values. It's context-driven and thus not suitable for values comparison."
Q134P,Frequency in your neighborhood: Police or military interfere with people’s private life (+),No,"Not selected; how often police/military interfere in private life is a contextual indicator of local governance issues, not a personal attitude held by the respondent, making it outside our focus on values."
Q135P,Frequency in your neighborhood: Racist behavior (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of racist behavior in the neighborhood is a context measure (how common an issue is locally), not a direct measure of the respondent's own values. It reflects environment rather than personal belief."
Q136P,Frequency in your neighborhood: Drug sale in streets (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of street drug sales is an environmental condition. It does not indicate the respondent's values or attitudes, so it is not useful for comparing core values."
Q137P,How frequently do the following things occur in your neighborhood: Street violence and fights (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of street violence/fights in the neighborhood is context-specific and not an expression of the respondent's values or beliefs, thus irrelevant for the values comparison."
Q138P,How frequently do the following things occur in your neighborhood: Sexual harassment (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of sexual harassment in the neighborhood is a contextual/social problem indicator, not a measure of a personal attitude or value, so it is excluded."
Q13P,Important child qualities: thrift saving money and things (+),No,"Not selected; thrift (saving money/things) as a child quality, while a value, tends to overlap with other work ethic values (like hard work). Many cultures value thrift similarly, making it somewhat redundant and less differentiating than other included values."
Q142P,Worries: Losing my job or not finding a job (+),No,"Not selected; worry about losing a job is a personal anxiety tied to economic security, not an expression of one's values or beliefs. It's context-dependent rather than a core value, so it's excluded."
Q143P,Worries: Not being able to give one's children a good education (+),No,"Not selected; worry about not affording children's education is a personal concern related to economic condition, not reflective of fundamental values or attitudes across groups, hence excluded."
Q146P,Worries: A war involving my country (+),No,"Not selected; fear of a war involving one's country is a situational anxiety rather than a stable value or belief. It's influenced by context (e.g., current tensions) and not indicative of core values across groups."
Q147P,Worries: A terrorist attack (+),No,"Not selected; worry about a terrorist attack is a contextual fear, not a core attitude or value held by the respondent about society. It doesn't reflect values differences, so it's excluded."
Q148P,Worries: A civil war (+),No,"Not selected; worry about civil war is a context-specific fear (especially relevant only in certain regions). It is not a personal value or belief, so it does not meet the criteria for inclusion."
Q149,Freedom and Equality - Which more important,Yes,"Selected; it directly asks which is more important: freedom or equality. This captures a fundamental political value orientation with expected differences across ideologies and cultures, albeit on a binary choice."
Q14P,Important child qualities: determination perseverance (+),No,"Not selected; determination/perseverance as a child quality is similar to the 'hard work' value (Q9P) already included. Including both would be redundant, so this one is dropped."
Q150,Freedom and security - Which more important,Yes,"Selected; it asks whether freedom or security is more important, a key values trade-off (liberty vs safety) that varies among individuals and societies, clearly highlighting core political priorities."
Q151P,Willingness to fight for country (+),Yes,"Selected; willingness to fight for one's country reflects patriotic values vs pacifism. This attitude varies across cultures and demographics (e.g., younger vs older, different national sentiments) and is clearly measured (yes/no)."
Q152,Aims of country: first choice,No,"Not selected; this is a ranking of country goals (first choice) with nominal options. While it pertains to values (economic growth vs defense vs local voice vs beauty), the format is not a Likert/ordinal scale and overlaps with Q153. Its analysis would require combining with second choice, making it unsuitable by our criteria."
Q153,Aims of country: second choice,No,"Not selected; it's the second choice in the same country goals ranking as Q152. It's redundant with Q152 and similarly not in a straightforward ordinal format. Thus, we exclude it and the entire ranking approach in favor of direct scale measures."
Q154,Aims of respondent: first choice,No,"Not selected; this asks for the respondent's first priority among four national issues (order, voice in decisions, prices, free speech). It's a ranking selection, which is nominal and not directly ordinal. While it indicates values (materialist vs post-materialist concerns), the format and redundancy with Q155 make it unsuitable."
Q155,Aims of respondent: second choice,No,"Not selected; as the second choice complement to Q154, it's part of a ranking task. It's redundant with Q154's content and not an independent scaled attitude, so it's excluded."
Q156,Most important: first choice,No,"Not selected; first choice among broad societal goals (economy, humane society, ideas over money, fight crime) – another ranking item. The nominal nature and need to pair with Q157 for full info make it less usable for straightforward comparisons."
Q157,Most important: second choice,No,"Not selected; second choice for societal goals, tied to Q156. It's not included due to the same reasons – it's part of a ranking with no simple ordinal scale and overlaps conceptually with Q156."
Q158,"Science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable",No,"Not selected; it asserts science/tech make life better (or not). This is largely redundant with Q163, which also measures overall view of science's impact. Q163 is retained as the representative item for this positive science attitude, so Q158 is dropped."
Q159,"Because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation",No,"Not selected; the idea that science means more opportunities for the next generation is another optimistic view of science. It's similar in spirit to Q158/Q163, and including it would be redundant. We focus on the overarching evaluation (Q163)."
Q15P,Important child qualities: religious faith (+),Yes,Selected; valuing religious faith in children highlights traditional religious values vs secular upbringing priorities. This clearly varies across societies (secular vs devout) and is a core cultural value.
Q160,We depend too much on science and not enough on faith,Yes,"Selected; agreement that we rely too much on science and not enough on faith captures a fundamental worldview (scientific vs religious reliance). It strongly reflects attitudes that differ by religiosity and education, with a clear disagree/agree scale."
Q161,One of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people’s ideas of right and wrong,No,"Not selected; the notion that science breaks down moral ideas overlaps with Q160 in expressing skepticism about science's effect on morality. Since Q160 covers the science vs faith conflict broadly, Q161 is redundant and thus excluded."
Q162,It is not important for me to know about science in my daily life,Yes,"Selected; saying it's not important to know about science in daily life gauges personal interest in/valuation of scientific knowledge. This attitude varies with education and culture (some value science literacy, others indifferent), so it fits our criteria."
Q163,"The world is better off, or worse off, because of science and technology",Yes,"Selected; it asks if the world is better or worse off because of science and technology, providing a direct overall attitude towards scientific progress. This is a core belief with wide variation and a 10-point scale, making it suitable."
Q164,Importance of God,Yes,"Selected; importance of God is a fundamental indicator of religiosity vs secularity. It varies immensely across individuals and cultures and uses a 10-point importance scale, aligning well with our criteria."
Q165P,Believe in: God (+),Yes,"Selected; belief in God (yes/no) is a direct personal belief measure. It's core to religious identity and varies across populations (e.g., secular vs devout societies), clearly indicating a fundamental belief."
Q166P,Believe in: life after death (+),Yes,Selected; belief in life after death is an essential spiritual belief that varies across and within cultures (religious vs non-religious individuals). It provides insight into the depth of spiritual values beyond just belief in God.
Q167P,Believe in: hell (+),No,"Not selected; belief in hell is highly correlated with general afterlife beliefs (like Q166) and is specific to certain religious doctrines. It's somewhat redundant with broader belief measures and less universally applicable, so it's excluded."
Q168P,Believe in: heaven (+),No,Not selected; belief in heaven is similarly redundant with the broader measure of afterlife belief (Q166). It adds a detail specific to particular religious traditions and thus is not included to avoid duplication.
Q169P,"Whenever science and religion conflict, religion is always right (+)",Yes,"Selected; the statement that whenever science and religion conflict, religion is always right gauges religious absolutism vs openness to science. It's a core attitude that varies (especially between fundamentalist and secular viewpoints) and is clearly defined."
Q16P,Important child qualities: unselfishness (+),Yes,"Selected; unselfishness as a desired child quality reflects the value placed on altruism vs individualism, which can vary culturally, making it a relevant core value measure."
Q170P,The only acceptable religion is my religion (+),Yes,"Selected; the belief that only one's own religion is acceptable measures religious intolerance vs pluralism. This is a fundamental attitude about diversity that varies widely among societies and individuals, making it important to compare."
Q171P,How often do you attend religious services (+),Yes,"Selected; frequency of attending religious services is a behavioral indicator of religiosity. It's included because it reflects the importance of religion in practice and varies across groups (some attend weekly, others never), illustrating religious commitment levels."
Q172P,How often to you pray (+),Yes,"Selected; frequency of prayer complements attendance as a measure of religiosity, capturing private devotion. This varies significantly among individuals and cultures and indicates depth of religious engagement."
Q173P,Religious person (+),Yes,"Selected; how the respondent labels themselves (religious, not, or atheist) is a direct self-assessment of religiosity. This is a core identity belief that varies widely, offering clear insight into religious vs secular identification."
Q176P,Degree of agreement: Nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow (+),Yes,"Selected; it addresses moral certainty vs ambiguity in society, reflecting attitudes toward moral relativism. This attitude can vary with societal change and personal ideology (traditional moral clarity vs moral relativism), making it a telling value indicator."
Q177,Justifiable: Claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled,No,"Not selected; justifying claiming government benefits one isn't entitled to is a measure of ethical permissiveness that overlaps with other included items (like tax cheating in Q180). To avoid redundancy, we exclude this specific scenario in favor of a broader representative."
Q178,Justifiable: Avoiding a fare on public transport,No,"Not selected; justifying avoiding a fare on public transport is another specific minor cheating behavior. It's covered by the general pattern of civic honesty we capture with the included item on tax cheating (Q180), so this is redundant."
Q179,Justifiable: Stealing property,No,"Not selected; justifying stealing property is almost universally rejected (a clear moral norm), leaving little cross-cultural variation. Because nearly everyone finds theft unjustifiable, it doesn't help differentiate values across groups."
Q17P,Important child qualities: obedience (+),Yes,"Selected; obedience in children indicates valuing discipline and authority. It directly contrasts with valuing independence (Q8P). Societies differ on how much obedience is prioritized, so this is a key traditional value to compare."
Q180,Justifiable: Cheating on taxes,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of cheating on taxes taps into civic morality and honesty. Attitudes here vary (some societies or individuals are more permissive toward cheating the state, others very strict), making it a useful comparative value measure on a 10-point scale."
Q181,Justifiable: Someone accepting a bribe in the course of their duties,No,"Not selected; justifying someone accepting a bribe in their duties gauges tolerance of corruption, but this overlaps with the general attitude captured by tax cheating (Q180) and overall corruption perceptions. To avoid duplication in measuring civic honesty/corruption tolerance, this item is excluded."
Q182,Justifiable: Homosexuality,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of homosexuality is a crucial indicator of social tolerance vs traditional morality. Acceptance levels vary drastically across countries, cultures, and generations, making this a core values measure (on a 10-point scale from never to always justifiable)."
Q183,Justifiable: Prostitution,No,"Not selected; justifiability of prostitution is a moral attitude question, but it's less central than other issues and likely correlates with general sexual morality measures (like Q182 or Q186). It's excluded to streamline the set without losing representativeness of the value domain."
Q184,Justifiable: Abortion,Yes,"Selected; attitude toward abortion (if it's justifiable) is a fundamental values issue often rooted in religious and moral beliefs. There is substantial cross-cultural and demographic variation (from very permissive to completely opposed), making it vital to include."
Q185,Justifiable: Divorce,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of divorce reflects traditional vs modern views on marriage permanence. While divorce is widely accepted in many places today, cultural and religious differences remain (some societies still stigmatize divorce more than others), so it provides insight into family values."
Q186,Justifiable: Sex before marriage,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of sex before marriage is a core measure of sexual morality, reflecting traditional vs liberal attitudes and varying widely by age, religion, and culture."
Q187,Justifiable: Suicide,No,"Not selected; attitude toward suicide (whether it's justifiable) does involve moral/religious judgment, but it's somewhat less central to comparative cultural values than other issues. Moreover, many cultures uniformly see it negatively (or it's tied to mental health views), so it's excluded in favor of more socially-oriented value items."
Q188,Justifiable: Euthanasia,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of euthanasia (mercy killing) is a significant ethical issue reflecting values about life and compassion vs religious morality. There is notable variation (some societies legalize/accept it, others strongly oppose), making it a relevant attitude to compare."
Q189,Justifiable: For a man to beat his wife,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of a man beating his wife is a stark measure of attitudes toward domestic violence and gender norms. In some cultures or groups, such violence has been traditionally tolerated to some degree, while others unequivocally condemn it. This large variation in a fundamental human rights value makes it critical to include."
Q18P,Neighbors: Drug addicts (+),No,"Not selected; not wanting drug addicts as neighbors is an attitude but one that is almost uniformly negative globally. It reflects aversion to a deviant or dangerous behavior more than a cultural value difference, offering minimal variation for analysis."
Q190,Justifiable: Parents beating children,Yes,"Selected; justifiability of parents beating children (corporal punishment) reveals values regarding child discipline and violence. There is cultural divergence here: some consider physical punishment acceptable or normal, while others see it as entirely unjustifiable. This attitudinal difference is important for comparison."
Q191,Justifiable: Violence against other people,No,"Not selected; justifying violence against other people in general is nearly universally rejected (most people say it's never justifiable to randomly commit violence). Because of this broad consensus, it doesn't help distinguish differing values across groups."
Q192,"Justifiable: Terrorism as a political, ideological or religious mean",No,"Not selected; justifiability of terrorism for a cause is an extreme scenario that almost everyone condemns. Only fringe variations exist, so it doesn't serve as a useful comparative value indicator (and it's very context-specific and sensitive)."
Q193,Justifiable: Having casual sex,No,"Not selected; justifiability of having casual sex is closely related to the premarital sex attitude (Q186) already included. Since attitudes towards casual sex likely correlate with attitudes toward premarital sex, including both would be redundant, so this one is omitted."
Q194,Justifiable: Political violence,No,"Not selected; justifiability of political violence overlaps with other violence/terrorism items. It’s generally condemned except in extreme views, and including it would be redundant given similar items. We focus on broader governance attitudes rather than specific violent methods."
Q195,Justifiable: Death penalty,Yes,"Selected; attitude toward the death penalty (justifiable or not) is a key value in the justice domain (punitive vs rehabilitative justice). Support for or opposition to capital punishment varies significantly across countries and groups, so it's a telling value difference."
Q196P,Government has the right: Keep people under video surveillance in public areas (+),No,Not selected; the idea that government has the right to use video surveillance in public is a privacy vs security trade-off item. We decided to include one representative from this set (Q197P) and exclude the rest to avoid redundancy. Q196P is therefore left out as its theme is covered by the selected item.
Q197P,Government has the right: Monitor all e-mails and any other information exchanged on the Internet (+),Yes,"Selected; whether the government should have the right to monitor all internet communications touches on privacy rights vs security/authority. This is a modern core value question (civil liberties in the digital age) with likely variation (some populations accept it for security, others reject it on principle)."
Q198P,Government has the right: Collect information about anyone living in [COUNTRY] without their knowledge (+),No,"Not selected; government collecting information secretly on citizens is another privacy vs security scenario. It's quite extreme and overlaps with the surveillance values captured in Q197P. To avoid duplication, we exclude this item and rely on the included one for the general attitude."
Q199P,Interest in politics (+),Yes,"Selected; interest in politics (not at all to very interested) reflects how much value an individual places on political matters and civic engagement. This varies by age, education, and culture (some societies have high political interest, others apathy), making it relevant for comparing civic attitudes."
Q19P,Neighbors: People of a different race (+),Yes,"Selected; indicating unwillingness to have people of a different race as neighbors reveals racial prejudice or tolerance. This is a core social attitude that varies across societies (some are more racially tolerant, others have significant prejudice), thus important for comparative analysis."
Q1P,Important in life: Family (+),No,"Not selected; family importance is nearly universal – almost everyone rates family as very important. Because there's minimal variation (virtually all groups highly value family), it doesn't differentiate values across groups despite being a core value."
Q200P,How often discusses political matters with friends (+),No,"Not selected; how often one discusses politics with friends is a behavioral tendency and social context indicator rather than a value or belief. It correlates with interest in politics (Q199P) which is included; thus, this is both not a core attitude on its own and somewhat redundant."
Q201P,Information source: Daily newspaper (B) (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of reading a daily newspaper is a media consumption habit, not a reflection of values or attitudes. It's largely driven by access and personal routine rather than core beliefs, so it's outside our focus."
Q202P,Information source: TV news (B) (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of watching TV news is a media consumption behavior. This depends on availability and habits (and age) more than on values, and doesn’t indicate an attitude to compare across groups, so it’s excluded."
Q203P,Information source: Radio news (B) (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of listening to radio news is a media use behavior rather than a value. It varies by technology access and personal habit, not by core attitudes, hence not included."
Q204P,Information source: Mobile phone (B) (+),No,"Not selected; using a mobile phone for news is again a measure of media/tech behavior. It's not a belief or value stance, so it doesn't meet the criteria for comparing values across groups."
Q205P,Information source: Email (B) (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of using email for information is a behavioral/technological metric, not indicative of the respondent's values or cultural attitudes, so it’s excluded."
Q206P,Information source: Internet (B) (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of Internet use for news is a personal habit reflecting tech usage, not a core value or attitude. Differences here are more about infrastructure and age than values, thus it’s not included."
Q207P,"Information source: Social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) (+)",No,"Not selected; use of social media for news is a media behavior. It doesn't directly reflect values or beliefs (beyond maybe generational tech differences), so it's outside the scope of core values comparison."
Q208P,Information source: Talk with friends or colleagues (B) (+),No,"Not selected; talking with friends or colleagues for information is a behavior related to social networks and engagement. While interesting socially, it’s not a direct measure of a personal value or attitude for our purposes."
Q209P,Political action: Signing a petition (+),No,"Not selected; willingness to sign a petition is a form of political participation behavior. It's not an attitude about an issue, but rather an action one might take (influenced by context and efficacy). As a behavior, it doesn't fulfill the criteria of a core value or belief question."
Q20P,Neighbors: People who have AIDS (+),Yes,"Selected; reluctance to have people with AIDS as neighbors indicates stigma or compassion regarding illness. Attitudes here vary by knowledge and culture (some communities stigmatize HIV/AIDS, others are more accepting), thus it reflects a value of tolerance vs prejudice toward a vulnerable group."
Q210P,Political action: joining in boycotts (+),No,"Not selected; willingness to join in boycotts is a specific activism behavior. It indicates propensity to protest economically, but as a behavioral tendency rather than a belief about something, it’s not included among core attitude measures."
Q211P,Political action: attending lawful/peaceful demonstrations (+),No,"Not selected; attending lawful demonstrations is another form of political participation (behavioral). It's influenced by opportunities and personal activism style, not a core value stance, so it's not selected."
Q212P,Political action: joining unofficial strikes (+),No,"Not selected; joining unofficial strikes is again about action willingness, which is behavior-based. We are focusing on attitudes and values content, so this item is excluded."
Q213P,Social activism: Donating to a group or campaign (+),No,"Not selected; donating to a group or campaign is a civic action, not a survey item about a belief or value. It reflects behavior (often tied to resources and context), thus it’s not directly a value to compare."
Q214P,Social activism: Contacting a government official (+),No,"Not selected; contacting a government official is an engagement behavior. While it shows political efficacy or involvement, it's not a question about a value or attitude difference, so it's left out."
Q215P,Social activism: Encouraging others to take action about political issues (+),No,Not selected; encouraging others to take political action is a participatory behavior metric. It's interesting for activism studies but not a core attitude measure per se; thus not included in the values-focused list.
Q216P,Social activism: Encouraging others to vote (+),No,"Not selected; encouraging others to vote is a civic behavior (promoting voting). It's a positive action but again a behavior rather than a belief question, so it doesn't meet the selection criteria."
Q217P,Political actions using Internet: Searching information about politics and political events (+),No,"Not selected; searching for political information online is a behavior reflecting interest and internet use. It's not a value or attitude statement, so we exclude it in favor of direct attitudinal measures."
Q218P,Political actions using Internet: Signing an electronic petition (+),No,"Not selected; signing an electronic petition is analogous to Q209P (petition signing) but online. As with other action items, it's a behavior, not a core belief, so it’s not selected."
Q219P,Political actions using Internet: Encouraging other people to take any form of political action (+),No,"Not selected; encouraging people online to take action is a digital form of activism. It's still an action tendency, not an attitude about a societal issue, therefore outside the scope of core values."
Q21P,Neighbors: Immigrants/foreign workers (+),Yes,"Selected; unwillingness to have immigrants/foreign workers as neighbors reveals xenophobia or openness. This is a crucial attitude that varies between more nationalistic versus more cosmopolitan societies, so it's included as a measure of social tolerance."
Q220P,"Political actions using Internet: Organizing political activities, events, protests (+)",No,"Not selected; organizing political activities online is a behavior (leadership in activism via the internet). It’s not a viewpoint on an issue, thus not a core attitude measure for our purposes."
Q221P,Vote in elections: local level (+),No,"Not selected; voting in local elections (never/always, etc) is a behavior/outcome which depends on legal factors and personal habit. It's not a value stance but rather civic participation frequency, so it's excluded."
Q222P,Vote in elections: National level (+),No,"Not selected; similarly, voting in national elections is a participation measure, not a core attitude or value. It's influenced by duty sense and context, but it's a behavior rather than belief, so it's not included."
Q224P,How often in country's elections: Votes are counted fairly (+),No,"Selected; perception of whether votes are counted fairly in national elections indicates trust in electoral integrity, a key component of political culture. This varies by country (some see elections as fair, others suspect fraud) and reflects democratic values vs cynicism."
Q225P,How often in country's elections: Opposition candidates are prevented from running (+),No,"Not selected; specific aspect of election fairness (e.g., opposition candidates being prevented) is covered generally by including one measure of election fairness (Q224), making additional similar items redundant."
Q226P,How often in country's elections: TV news favors the governing party (+),No,"Not selected; the idea that TV news favors the governing party is another detailed indicator of election fairness/media bias. It's context-specific and overlaps with the broader theme of electoral fairness already captured, so it's omitted."
Q227P,How often in country's elections: Voters are bribed (+),No,"Not selected; perception that voters are bribed is a specific corrupt practice in elections. While important locally, it's another facet of election integrity covered by general trust in elections measures; thus, it's excluded to avoid too many granular overlaps."
Q228P,How often in country's elections: Journalists provide fair coverage of elections (+),No,"Not selected; whether journalists provide fair election coverage is a detailed aspect of electoral process quality. It's context-specific and largely correlates with overall election fairness perceptions (like Q224), so we exclude it."
Q229P,How often in country's elections: Election officials are fair (+),No,"Not selected; perception of fair election officials is another granular detail of election integrity. It's not included separately because a general measure of perceived election fairness is already selected, and this detail would be redundant."
Q22P,Neighbors: Homosexuals (+),Yes,"Selected; unwillingness to have homosexuals as neighbors reflects social tolerance (or prejudice) regarding LGBTQ individuals, a key attitude that widely varies across cultures."
Q230P,How often in country's elections: Rich people buy elections (+),No,"Not selected; the view that rich people buy elections highlights corruption/inequality in politics, which is a facet of electoral fairness. This overlaps with broader democracy and fairness perceptions we've included and thus is left out to avoid redundancy."
Q231P,How often in country's elections: Voters are threatened with violence at the polls (+),No,"Not selected; concern that voters are threatened with violence is a very specific election malfeasance scenario. It's important in certain contexts but not a core value difference (most agree it's bad), and it correlates with general perceptions of election freedom, so it's excluded."
Q232P,How often in country's elections: Voters are offered a genuine choice in the elections (+),No,Not selected; whether voters are offered a genuine choice in elections is essentially another way to gauge election freedom. We have included key democracy indicators and including every sub-item would be redundant; thus this is left out.
Q233P,How often in country's elections: Women have equal opportunities to run the office (+),No,"Not selected; whether women have equal opportunities to run for office is an important issue, but as part of the election series it overlaps with gender equality attitudes measured elsewhere (e.g., Q249 about equal rights in democracy, and Q29P about women leaders). It's excluded here to avoid duplication of the gender equality theme."
Q23P,Neighbors: People of a different religion (+),Yes,"Selected; unwillingness to have neighbors of a different religion reveals religious intolerance vs pluralism. This attitude toward religious out-groups varies (some societies are very tolerant, others have sectarian divisions), making it a key comparative value."
Q234P,Some people think that having honest elections makes a lot of difference in their lives; other people think that it doesn’t matter much (+),Yes,"Selected; it gauges how important honest elections are to the respondent (whether it makes a difference). This indicates how much they value living in a democratic system versus being cynical. Variation in this belief reflects democratic aspirations vs apathy, so it's a valuable attitude to compare."
Q235P,Political system: Having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections,Yes,"Selected; opinion on having a strong leader who doesn't bother with elections tests acceptance of authoritarian rule vs commitment to democracy. This is a fundamental political value: some prefer a strongman for stability, others see it as very bad. The variation makes it crucial to include."
Q236P,Political system: Having experts make decisions (+),Yes,"Selected; attitude toward rule by experts (technocracy) reflects preferences in governance style (expert-led vs democratic), providing insight into values about decision-making that vary by society."
Q237P,Political system: Having the army rule (+),Yes,"Selected; acceptance of military rule captures authoritarian vs democratic orientation, an essential political value indicator with significant cross-national differences."
Q238P,Political system: Having a democratic political system (+),Yes,"Selected; opinion on having a democratic political system (likely positive in most cases) is included as a baseline for pro-democracy sentiment, which, while often high, can vary in degree of support across societies."
Q239P,Political system: Having a system governed by religious law in which there are no political parties or elections (+),Yes,"Selected; view on a religious law-based system without parties measures acceptance of theocracy vs secular democracy, an important value particularly in religious vs secular societies, clearly relevant and varying."
Q24P,Neighbors: Heavy drinkers (+),No,"Not selected; not wanting heavy drinkers as neighbors is quite common across cultures since heavy drinking often implies disruptive behavior. Because aversion here is near-universal (it's more a personal nuisance concern than a cultural value stance), it doesn't serve well to differentiate values and is excluded."
Q241,Democracy: Governments tax the rich and subsidize the poor,Yes,"Selected; whether taxing the rich to subsidize the poor is seen as part of democracy touches on beliefs about social equality and the role of redistribution. This is a value-laden concept that varies by ideology (e.g., egalitarian vs libertarian views) and thus is included."
Q242,Democracy: Religious authorities interpret the laws,Yes,"Selected; view on religious authorities interpreting the laws in a democracy touches on secular vs religious visions of governance. This reveals a core value conflict (secular democracy vs theocratic influence) which varies widely, especially between more secular and more religious societies."
Q243,Democracy: People choose their leaders in free elections,Yes,"Selected; believing that people choosing their leaders in free elections is essential to democracy is fundamental – although likely widely agreed, it indicates understanding of democracy and can highlight differences in emphasis or misunderstanding across contexts."
Q244,Democracy: People receive state aid for unemployment,No,Not selected; state aid for the unemployed as a component of democracy overlaps with the broader item on economic equality (Q241) and is thus redundant.
Q245,Democracy: The army takes over when government is incompetent,Yes,"Selected; the idea that the army stepping in when the government is incompetent could be part of democracy tests tolerance for military intervention in politics. Endorsement of this varies by political culture, indicating authoritarian vs democratic values, so it's important to include."
Q246,Democracy: Civil rights protect people’s liberty against oppression,Yes,"Selected; seeing civil rights protection as essential to democracy reflects values of liberty and rule of law, a core democratic principle – while often agreed upon, the strength of endorsement can vary and is important to capture."
Q247,Democracy: The state makes people's incomes equal,No,"Not selected; the state making people's incomes equal is another economic equality perspective, similar to Q241. To avoid duplication in the democracy attributes section, this item is excluded since the concept of economic equality in democracy is already captured."
Q248,Democracy: People obey their rulers,Yes,"Selected; belief that people must obey their rulers as part of democracy indicates an authoritarian interpretation of democracy (emphasizing order over freedom). This misunderstanding or value tilt varies (some populations stress obedience to authority, others do not), making it a revealing attitude to compare."
Q249,Democracy: Women have the same rights as men,Yes,"Selected; belief that women having the same rights as men is essential to democracy ties gender equality to democratic values. In many places it's assumed essential, but in some traditional contexts people might not see it that way. It captures the link between gender values and political values, which is important to measure."
Q250,Importance of democracy,Yes,"Selected; it directly measures how important democracy is to the respondent. This indicates commitment to democratic values versus indifference, which varies across individuals and societies, on a clear 10-point importance scale."
Q251,How democratically is this country being governed today,No,"Not selected; it asks how democratically the country is governed (perception of current system). This is a context evaluation, not the respondent’s own values. It's excluded because it reflects external reality more than personal belief."
Q252,Satisfaction with the political system performance,No,"Not selected; satisfaction with the political system’s performance is an opinion on current conditions, not a core value or belief. It's highly context-dependent, so it’s not included for value comparison."
Q253P,Respect for individual human rights nowadays (+),No,"Not selected; it gauges current respect for human rights in the country, which is an external assessment of the regime's performance rather than the respondent’s values. Thus, it’s outside the scope of personal values and excluded."
Q254P,How proud of nationality (+),Yes,"Selected; pride in one's nationality is a core attitude reflecting nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, with strong variation across countries and demographics, clearly measured by degree of pride."
Q255P,"How close you feel: Your [village, town or city] (+)",Yes,"Selected; feeling of closeness to one's town/city (local community attachment) reflects the strength of local identity. This can vary (some feel very attached locally, others less so especially in mobile or individualistic societies), providing insight into community-oriented values."
Q256P,I see myself as member of my local community (+),No,"Not selected; seeing oneself as a member of the local community is very similar to Q255P’s concept of local attachment. It’s redundant with Q255P, so we exclude this to avoid duplication."
Q257P,I see myself as citizen of the [country] nation (+),No,"Not selected; identifying as a citizen of the nation is largely captured by national pride (Q254P) and is a similar measure of national attachment, thus redundant."
Q258P,"How close you feel: Continent; e.g. Europe, Asia etc.] (+)",No,Not selected; feeling close to one’s continent is a more region-specific identity that may not be universally meaningful and overlaps with local/global identity measures; excluded to streamline the set.
Q259P,How close you feel: World (+),Yes,"Selected; feeling of closeness to the world (global identity) reflects cosmopolitanism, a value that contrasts with local/national focus and varies among individuals and cultures, making it a relevant attitude to compare."
Q25P,Neighbors: Unmarried couples living together (+),Yes,"Selected; unwillingness to have unmarried couples living together as neighbors reflects traditional vs liberal attitudes toward cohabitation and family norms. In more traditional societies this is frowned upon, while in liberal ones it's accepted, hence it's a telling social values indicator."
Q26P,Neighbors: People who speak a different language (+),Yes,"Selected; not wanting neighbors who speak a different language indicates cultural/linguistic intolerance vs openness. This attitude varies especially in mono-ethnic vs multi-ethnic societies, reflecting openness to diversity in daily life."
Q27P,One of main goals in life has been to make my parents proud (+),Yes,"Selected; having as a life goal to make my parents proud reflects filial piety and family orientation, a value that varies across cultures (strong in collectivist societies, less emphasized in individualist ones), clearly indicating a core value stance."
Q28P,Pre-school child suffers with working mother (+),Yes,"Selected; belief that a preschool child suffers if the mother works captures traditional vs modern views on gender roles and child-rearing, a significant attitude differing across societies and generations."
Q29P,Men make better political leaders than women do (+),Yes,"Selected; view that men make better political leaders than women is a direct measure of gender bias in leadership, which varies globally and by demographics, reflecting a core attitude about gender equality."
Q2P,Important in life: Friends (+),Yes,"Selected; importance of friends in one's life is a value priority that can vary (some cultures put more emphasis on friendship vs family or work), providing insight into social value differences with an ordinal scale."
Q30P,University is more important for a boy than for a girl (+),Yes,"Selected; agreement that university is more important for a boy than a girl measures educational gender bias, directly reflecting attitudes toward gender equality in education, with clear variation in traditional vs egalitarian contexts."
Q31P,Men make better business executives than women do (+),No,"Not selected; believing men are better business executives is another gender stereotype similar to Q29P (men better leaders). It's redundant in measuring gender bias, thus excluded to avoid duplication."
Q32P,Being a housewife just as fulfilling (+),Yes,"Selected; the view that being a housewife is as fulfilling as having a job reflects attitudes on women's role and fulfillment, varying by traditional vs modern outlook (some value homemaking equally, others see career as necessary for fulfillment)."
Q33P,Jobs scarce: Men should have more right to a job than women (+),Yes,"Selected; the idea that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce is a stark indicator of gender-based discrimination in economic opportunities, a core value difference that varies widely across societies."
Q34P,Jobs scarce: Employers should give priority to (nation) people than immigrants (+),Yes,"Selected; belief that employers should give priority to natives over immigrants for jobs when jobs are scarce reflects nationalist vs cosmopolitan economic values, which differ significantly across countries and groups."
Q35P,Problem if women have more income than husband (+),Yes,"Selected; thinking it would be a problem if a wife earns more than her husband indicates traditional gender norms vs egalitarian views in the household, a value attitude that varies by culture and gender norms."
Q36P,Homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples (+),No,"Not selected; believing homosexual couples are as good parents as others is closely related to general attitudes toward homosexuality (already covered by Q182). It is somewhat redundant since acceptance of gay parenting likely correlates with general acceptance of homosexuality, so it's excluded."
Q37P,Duty towards society to have children (+),Yes,"Selected; viewing having children as a duty to society reflects pronatalist values vs individual choice, which varies (some societies pressure childbearing as duty, others emphasize personal choice), making it a relevant attitude."
Q38P,It is child's duty to take care of ill parent (+),Yes,"Selected; belief that it's a child's duty to take care of an ill parent (filial obligation) reflects family responsibility values, which differ culturally (strong filial piety in some societies vs more individualistic expectations elsewhere)."
Q39P,People who don't work turn lazy (+),Yes,"Selected; the idea that people who don't work become lazy reflects a work ethic and view of unemployment (blame on individual vs circumstances), which varies across cultures (some have strong work ethic norm, others more sympathetic), indicating core attitude differences."
Q3P,Important in life: Leisure time (+),Yes,"Selected; importance of leisure time reflects a value on work-life balance vs work centrism, varying by culture (some prioritize leisure and quality of life more, others emphasize work), making it a key lifestyle value indicator."
Q40P,Work is a duty towards society (+),No,"Not selected; the statement that work is a duty to society overlaps with other work ethic items (like Q39P) in emphasizing moral obligation to work. It's excluded as its core idea is captured by related included items, to avoid redundancy."
Q41P,Work should come first even if it means less spare time (+),Yes,"Selected; the view that work should come first even at the cost of less spare time reflects prioritization of work over leisure, indicative of a work-centric vs balanced lifestyle value, which can vary across groups."
Q42,Basic kinds of attitudes concerning society,Yes,"Selected; this item outlines basic attitudes toward societal change (revolutionary change, gradual reform, or defending the status quo). This encapsulates one's orientation towards social change vs stability, which is a fundamental political attitude that varies by ideology and context."
Q43P,Future changes: Less importance placed on work (+),No,"Not selected; opinion on placing less importance on work in the future is essentially a hypothetical scenario reflecting work ethic values, which are already captured by other items (like Q39P, Q41P). It's redundant in measuring attitudes toward work."
Q44P,Future changes: More emphasis on technology (+),No,Not selected; attitude toward more emphasis on technology in the future overlaps with general attitudes toward science/tech (already captured by items like Q163). It's excluded as a redundant measure of pro- or anti-technology sentiment.
Q45P,Future changes: Greater respect for authority (+),No,"Not selected; view on greater respect for authority in the future is a hypothetical variant of attitudes toward authority which are directly measured by other items (e.g., obedience, strong leader), making this item redundant."
Q46P,Feeling of happiness (+),No,"Not selected; happiness level is an outcome/subjective well-being measure, not a core value or attitude that one holds, so it does not meet the criteria of reflecting values."
Q47P,State of health (subjective) (+),No,"Not selected; self-rated health is a personal status, not an attitude or belief, and thus not relevant for comparing values or beliefs."
Q48,How much freedom of choice and control,No,"Not selected; perceived freedom of choice in life is an experiential measure (likely reflecting personal circumstances or societal conditions) rather than a value stance, so it's excluded."
Q49,Satisfaction with your life,No,"Not selected; life satisfaction is a subjective outcome, not a value or belief, and thus falls outside the scope of core values/attitudes for this analysis."
Q4P,Important in life: Politics (+),Yes,"Selected; importance of politics in one's life reflects the value placed on political engagement, which varies (some are apathetic, others passionate), providing insight into civic-mindedness across groups."
Q50,Satisfaction with financial situation of household,No,"Not selected; satisfaction with household financial situation is a personal outcome measure tied to economic conditions, not an indicator of values or attitudes."
Q51P,Frequency you/family (last 12 month): Gone without enough food to eat (+),No,"Not selected; the frequency of going without enough food is an indicator of material hardship, not an attitude or belief, thus not relevant for a values comparison."
Q52P,Frequency you/family (last 12 month): Felt unsafe from crime in your own home (+),No,"Not selected; frequency of feeling unsafe from crime at home is an experience measure, reflecting external conditions rather than personal values."
Q53P,Frequency you/family (last 12 month): Gone without needed medicine or treatment that you needed (+),No,"Not selected; going without needed medicine is a hardship indicator, not a value or attitude."
Q54P,Frequency you/family (last 12 month): Gone without a cash income (+),No,"Not selected; going without a cash income is a measure of poverty experience, not reflecting personal beliefs or values."
Q55P,"In the last 12 month, how often have you or your family: Gone without a safe shelter over your head (+)",No,"Not selected; lacking safe shelter is a situational hardship measure, not a core value or attitude of the respondent."
Q56P,Standard of living comparing with your parents (+),No,"Not selected; comparing one's standard of living to one's parents is an evaluative judgment of social mobility, not an expression of values or beliefs."
Q57P,Most people can be trusted,Yes,"Selected; the general trust question (whether most people can be trusted) is a classic measure of social capital and interpersonal values, with large cross-cultural variations (some societies are high-trust, others low-trust)."
Q58P,Trust: Your family (+),No,"Not selected; trust in one's family is nearly universally high and more of a given than a value-based choice, yielding little variation and limited analytical value."
Q59P,Trust: Your neighborhood (B) (+),No,"Not selected; trust in neighbors, while an attitude, tends to be context-specific and overlaps with general social trust; including the broad trust measure (Q57P) is sufficient, making this one somewhat redundant."
Q5P,Important in life: Work (+),Yes,"Selected; importance of work in life is a key value question (work centrality vs other priorities). While many value work, the degree can differ by culture (some live to work, others work to live). This variation provides a window into the work ethic and life priority differences."
Q60P,Trust: People you know personally (+),No,"Not selected; trust in people you know personally is typically high since these are chosen relationships. It doesn't reveal much about generalized trust or values beyond personal circle and shows little variation (most trust their friends), so it's excluded."
Q61P,Trust: People you meet for the first time (+),No,"Not selected; trust in people met for the first time essentially overlaps with the general trust question (Q57P) in gauging trust in strangers, so it's redundant."
Q62P,Trust: People of another religion (+),No,"Not selected; trust in people of another religion is an intergroup trust measure already covered by the neighbor tolerance item for different religions (Q23P), making it somewhat redundant in capturing religious tolerance."
Q63P,Trust: People of another nationality (+),No,"Not selected; trust in people of another nationality overlaps with the neighbor immigrant tolerance item (Q21P) in assessing xenophobia/cosmopolitan trust, thus excluded to avoid duplication."
Q64P,Confidence: Churches (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in churches/religious institutions reflects trust in a major social institution and ties to religiosity vs secularism, varying widely across countries (e.g., high in religious societies, low in secular), reflecting an important cultural attitude toward institutions."
Q65P,Confidence: Armed Forces (+),No,"Selected; confidence in the armed forces indicates trust in the military, an institution valued differently across societies (some have high respect for military, others distrust it), providing insight into authority and security values."
Q66P,Confidence: The Press (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in the press (news media) measures trust in information sources and free media, a crucial aspect of civic values and institutional trust, with notable differences across countries (depending on media freedom and public opinion)."
Q67P,Confidence: Television (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in television news is a similar measure to confidence in the press regarding media trust. Since we've included the press or media in general (Q66P) is sufficient, so this is redundant."
Q68P,Confidence: Labor Unions (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in labor unions reflects attitudes toward organized labor and workers' representation, varying by political ideology and country (strong union cultures vs not), thus relevant for comparative values."
Q69P,Confidence: The Police (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in the police gauges trust in law enforcement, a core institution; this varies with experiences of corruption or safety in different societies, and is a key attitude toward authority and order."
Q6P,Important in life: Religion (+),Yes,"Selected; importance of religion in one's life is a fundamental value question distinguishing secular vs religious orientations, with high cross-cultural variance, measured on an ordinal importance scale."
Q70P,Confidence: Justice System/Courts (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in the justice system/courts measures trust in rule of law institutions, which is crucial for understanding civic values and varies (some societies trust courts, others see them as corrupt)."
Q71P,Confidence: The Government (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in the government (executive branch) is a key political trust indicator reflecting attitudes toward authority and performance of leaders, varying by national context and personal ideology."
Q72P,Confidence: The Political Parties (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in political parties assesses trust in the party system, often low in many places and varying widely, which speaks to political cynicism vs trust – an important political attitude to compare."
Q73P,Confidence: Parliament (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in parliament (legislature) indicates trust in democratic institutions of governance, with variation across countries based on perceived performance and democratic culture."
Q74P,Confidence: The Civil Services (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in the civil service overlaps with overall government trust measures (Q71P) as it pertains to state institutions, making it somewhat redundant in capturing institutional trust."
Q75P,Confidence: Universities (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in universities, while an interesting measure of trust in academia, is less central to core values and typically high in most places (and correlates with general trust in institutions), so it's excluded."
Q76P,Confidence: Elections (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in elections overlaps with specific election fairness perception items already considered (like Q224) and is context-specific, thus excluded to reduce redundancy."
Q77P,Confidence: Major Companies (+),Yes,"Selected; confidence in major companies reflects trust in large business institutions or capitalism, a value-laden attitude (some trust corporations, others are skeptical) that can vary across different economic cultures."
Q78P,Confidence: Banks (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in banks is related to trust in financial institutions, which often correlates with trust in companies or the economy in general; including one broad economic institution (Q77P) suffices, making this redundant."
Q79P,Confidence: The Environmental Protection Movement (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in the environmental protection movement, while value-related (reflecting environmental concern/trust), is somewhat niche and overlaps with general environmental values captured elsewhere (like Q111), so it's excluded."
Q7P,Important child qualities: good manners (+),No,"Not selected; good manners as a child quality is broadly valued and tends to correlate with traditional upbringing values like obedience. Since we've chosen obedience and similar values, this item is largely redundant and offers less differentiation (most agree manners are important), so it's not included."
Q80P,Confidence: The Women's Movement (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in the women's movement is a specific trust measure that overlaps with general attitudes toward gender equality (which are directly measured by other items like Q29P, Q249), thus redundant."
Q81P,Confidence: Charitable or humanitarian organizations (+),No,"Not selected; confidence in charitable/humanitarian organizations is a specialized trust in NGOs which, while interesting, is less about core personal values and more about institutional performance perceptions; it's excluded to focus on broader values."
Q8P,Important child qualities: independence (+),Yes,"Selected; independence as an important child quality represents valuing self-reliance and autonomy, a core value that contrasts with obedience (Q17P) and varies among cultures (individualistic vs collectivist)."
Q90,International organizations: being effective vs being democratic,Yes,"Selected; the preference for international organizations being effective vs democratic captures a global governance value trade-off, reflecting whether people prioritize efficiency or democratic principles internationally, varying by political culture."
Q9P,Important child qualities: hard work (+),Yes,"Selected; hard work as an important child quality reflects emphasis on work ethic and ambition, a core value that can vary (some prioritize it highly, others less so), and it's clearly measured (mentioned or not)."
